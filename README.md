# Description 

As the gift-giving time of the year is approaching, we would like to help people create a list of what they wish for. The goal of this project was to build a web application using the MERN stack: Mongo, Express, Node and React and deployed to Heroku. With this application you are able to:

- Create an account and log in
- Add items to your wishlist for Christmas
